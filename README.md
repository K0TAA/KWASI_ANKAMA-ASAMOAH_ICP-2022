# KWASI ANKAMA-ASAMOAH'S INDIVIDUAL PROJECT

To run my program you will need to open the whole "Kwasi_Ankama-Asamoah's_Individual_Project" folder within your IDE and run the "Main.java" file.

For the input value requested you will need to type in "test.txt" file to generate the output file ("test_output.txt").

To edit the start and destination points edit the "test.txt" file by switching the inputed values within that file to your desired inputs (using the input format: City, Country) and rerun the "Main.java" program to update the new output file ("test_output.txt").
